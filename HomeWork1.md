# Homework 1

## Create a personal GitHub page

A GitHub page is an easy and free way to host static content on the web.
GitHub pages are hosted on the `my-name.github.io` domain.

### Task definition

- Follow the tutorial at https://pages.github.com/ to create your personal GitHub page.
  - Create a repository on GitHub
  - Clone that repository and start creating you pages.
    - Create an index.html page that prints your name (and any other content you want)
  - Push the changes and open your site "your-name.github.io"

### Requirements

- Your site must contain at least some HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (You may use any additional technologies)
- Your repository should contain at least 10 commits.
- You should use feature branches as part of your git workflow.
- Commits should be well defined and contain a relevant set of changes.
- Commit names should be informative. Bonus points if they are linked to cards in trello / jira
