## Homework requirements

You can find a list of task ideas here: [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/intro-to-git/projects/1/views/1)

The main repository for the homework tasks is here: [Homework2 Repo](https://github.com/intro-to-git/fall-2025-homework-2/tree/main)

Pick one of the tasks, assign it to yourself and create a PR (pull request)
with the solution.

Additionally, you must review the PR of one of your classmates - write comments
on their PR and approve it when they are ready.

If you prefer to work on a task that is not on the list, please ping me,
so I can approve your idea.

Also as always, please contact me if you have any questions or problems.
