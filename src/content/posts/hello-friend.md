Welcome in demo of the `Terminal` theme. Please, look around and check whether this is something for you. And if you like it, give it a chance.

Also, if you start a blog, remember about this quote:

> "Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats."

And one more small thing. You can also set **coverImage** for your posts...
